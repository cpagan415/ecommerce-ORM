# E-commerce ORM Challenge 13 

## Description

This program is a back-end application for an ecommerce website that holds various products in a database. The database has information about price and stock. Each products is organized by category and tag name. This was a coding challenge done for UCF's web development bootcamp. The challenge required to set up get, post, put, and delete api routes and models to have a fully functioning back-end application.
